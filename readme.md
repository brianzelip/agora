# Front end test by Brian Zelip

To serve this Foundation CLI project locally (requires node.js):

1. If you don't have Foundation's CLI tool globally available, install it with `npm install --global foundation-cli`.

2. Clone this repo, then `cd` into it.

3. Install the npm depencies from within the root of this repo: `npm install`.

4. Finally, to build and view this project, run `foundation watch`, which will open up the redesign in your preferred browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

5. To see the output of my solutions to the debug test, go to `http://localhost:8000/debug-test.html`.
