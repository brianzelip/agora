    <p>Let me repeat that… for any reason at all, simply request a refund and we’ll be happy to oblige.</p>
    <p class="fs9 fw800">And your guarantee NEVER expires.</p>
    <p>You can request a refund any time in the future – it could be six months from now… a year… or even two!</p>
    <p>This way, there’s no pressure… and no risk… when you try Berbinex C3 today.</p>
    <p>So let’s do this: Fill out your shipping information on the next page.</p>
    <p>Once you do, we’ll begin packing your shipment of Berbinex C3 and then we’ll rush it your way.</p>
    <p>Just a few short days from now, you’ll receive a plain, brown box from USPS.</p>
    <p>Carefully packed inside will be your initial supply of Berbinex C3.</p>
    <p>I recommend you immediately bring your Berbinex C3 supply into your kitchen, open it up…</p>
    <p>…and have it ready before your very next meal.</p>
    <p>As you eat, the ingredients inside Berbinex C3 will begin working with your blood cells and muscles...</p>
    <p>And before you know it…</p>
    <p>Your AMPK will be activated, keeping your blood sugar perfect, and keeping YOU HEALTHY.</p>
    <p>As time goes on, you’ll feel the effects all day long and see the changes in your mirror.</p>
    <p>You’ll even ask yourself, “How did I ever live without Berbinex C3?”</p>
    <p>And that’s an important question… so we want to make sure you’re never without the blood sugar balancing power of Berbinex
      C3.
    </p>
    <p>Because if you stop taking Berbinex C3, there’s a very real chance your Master Metabolic Switch will turn right back
      off… and then it will all be for nothing.</p>
    <p>So, today, through this special offer, we’re giving you free access to our Priority Pass program.</p>
    <p>That means, whenever you’re about to run out of Berbinex C3, we’ll ship you out a fresh supply and simply bill the credit
      card you use today.</p>
    <p>Not only that, you lock in today’s special low price. And we’ll even pick up the shipping cost.</p>
